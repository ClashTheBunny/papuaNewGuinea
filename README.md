This is a visualization of money raised to sponsor hospital trips via plane for remote communities in Papua New Guinea.

For every $150, the children would be able to pay for a plane to fly on one leg of a trip.  
The plane was based in one city, the people were in another city, and the hospital was in a third.
The visualization randomly selects a large city on the map and plans a route for the plane to make it to
that city.  It then shows an animation of a plane flying and the count of total full legs of the trip that were sponsored.

Enter a number at the bottom for the dollar amount raised.  Push "go".  The plane flys until it runs out of gas and lands
at that point to show lack of completion and how much more needs to be raised.
